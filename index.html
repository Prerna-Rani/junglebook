        <i>The Jungle Book</i>
    </h3>
    <!------------------------------------------paragraph1----------------------------------------------->
    <p style="text-align: left;">
        The Jungle Book is an 1894 collection of stories by the English author Rudyard Kipling. Most of the characters
        are animals such as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear, though a principal character is the boy or
        "man-cub" Mowgli, who is raised in the jungle by wolves. Most stories are set in a forest in India; one place
        mentioned repeatedly is "Seeonee" (Seoni), in the central state of Madhya Pradesh. A major theme in the book is
        abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. The theme is
        echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies, as well
        as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still
        less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach respect
        for authority, obedience, and knowing one's place in society with "the law of the jungle", but the stories also
        illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the
        village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the
        irresponsible side of human nature. The Jungle Book has remained popular, partly through its many adaptations
        for film and other media. Critics such as Swati Singh have noted that even critics wary of Kipling for his
        supposed imperialism have admired the power of his storytelling.[1] The book has been influential in the scout
        movement, whose founder, Robert Baden-Powell, was a friend of Kipling.[2] Percy Grainger composed his Jungle
        Book Cycle around quotations from the book.
        Rudyard Kipling's stories were first printed in magazines in 1893 and 1894; the original publications also
        contained hand-sketched illustrations, with some from John Lockwood Kipling, his father. Rudyard himself was
        born in Mumbai—then referred to as Bombay—in the western coastal Indian state of Maharashtra, where he spent his
        first six years of life. After around 10 years back in England, and having completed his schooling, Kipling went
        back to India to work for nearly 6½ years. Later on, his original stories would be written when he lived at
        Naulakha, the property and home he owned in Dummerston, Vermont, US.[3] There is evidence that Kipling wrote the
        collection of stories for his daughter, Josephine (who died from pneumonia in 1899, aged 6); a first-edition
        copy of the book—including a handwritten note by the author to his young daughter—was discovered at the National
        Trust's Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.

        The stories in The Jungle Book were inspired in part by the ancient Indian fable texts such as the Panchatantra
        and the Jataka tales.[7] For example, an older moral-filled mongoose and snake version of the "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"
        story by Kipling is found in Book 5 of Panchatantra.[8] In a letter to the American author Edward Everett Hale,
        Kipling wrote.

        story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back from the 22nd century to help a

        AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an English-language release in North America in
        2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Doraemon was well received by critics and

        in 1973 and 1994, the Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982, and the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize
        in 1997. As of 2024, it has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling manga
        series of all time. The character of Doraemon has been viewed as a Japanese cultural icon, and was appointed as
        the first "anime ambassador" in 2008 by the country's Foreign Ministry.
