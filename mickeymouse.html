            Mickey Mouse is an American cartoon character co-created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The longtime
            icon and mascot of the Walt Disney Company, Mickey is an anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red
            shorts, large shoes, and white gloves. He is often depicted alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet
            dog Pluto, his friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete.

            Mickey was created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The character was
            originally to be named "Mortimer Mouse", until Disney's wife, Lillian, suggested "Mickey". Mickey first
            appeared in two 1928 shorts Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho (which were not picked up for distribution)
            before his public debut in Steamboat Willie (1928). The character went on to appear in over 130 films,
            mostly shorts as well as features such as Fantasia (1940). Since 1930, Mickey has been featured extensively
            in comic strips (including the Mickey Mouse comic strip, which ran for 45 years) and comic books (such as
            Mickey Mouse). The character has also been featured in television series such as The Mickey Mouse Club
            (1955â€“1996).

            Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks, Mickey is traditionally
            characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger
            than himself. The character's depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and
            falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Walt Disney. Though originally characterized
            as a cheeky lovable rogue, Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy, usually seen as a spirited, yet
            impulsive hero.

            Mickey also appears in media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the
            Disney parks. He is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters. Ten
            of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend a
            Paw, won the award in 1941. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the
            Hollywood Walk of Fame.
